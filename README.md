# Assignment 5
TASK A
A dictionary students stores student names as keys and their marks as values.

The program takes a name from the user using input().

if name in students: checks whether the entered name exists as a key in the dictionary.

If it exists, the student’s marks are printed; otherwise, a “not found” message is shown.

TASK B
The loop fills the list with numbers from 1 to 10 using append().

list[:5] uses slicing to take elements from index 0 up to (but not including) index 5 → first 5 elements.

list[5:] takes elements starting from index 5 till the end → last 5 elements.

Python slicing is zero-based and the end index is always excluded.
